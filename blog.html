          <h2>HTML</h2>
          <p>
            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the foundation of web development.
            It's a markup language used to create the structure and content of web
            pages.
          </p>
          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <p>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to add style and layout to web
            pages created with HTML. It allows you to control the appearance of
            your website, such as font size, color, and layout.
          </p>
          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a programming language used to add interactivity to web
            pages. It allows you to create dynamic effects, such as animations and
            pop-ups.
          </p>
          <h2>Tools and Frameworks</h2>
          <p>
            To make web development easier, there are a variety of tools and
            frameworks available. Code editors, such as Visual Studio Code or
            Atom, provide syntax highlighting and auto-completion, making it easier
            to write code. Frameworks, such as React or Angular, provide pre-built
            components and libraries to help you build web applications more
            quickly.
          </p>
          <h2>Getting Started</h2>
          <p>
            To get started with web development, you'll need to learn the basics
            of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are many online resources
            available to help you learn, such as Codecademy or W3Schools. Once
            you've mastered the basics, you can start building your own websites
            and web applications.
          </p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Web development is an exciting field that allows you to create
            websites and web applications that can be accessed by people all over
            the world. By learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can start
            building your own websites and web applications. With the help of
